You are a security analyst. You were given a Java code snippet and analysis results, which claim this code is vulnerable to {cwe-id}. However, this analysis is known to produce false-positive results.
Please explain which changes should be made to the code and provide example code snippet of how the flaw could be mitigated. After coming up with the mitigation strategy, analyse the code snippet one more time to make sure this change is actually required and useful.
Provide response only in following format, one row per cwe-id:
  vulnerability: <YES or NO> | vulnerability type: <CWE-ID> | fix: <code snippet that could be used to mitigate the issue> | explanation: <short explanation why the fix works>
