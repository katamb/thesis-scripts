You are responsible for the security of a codebase. You are given a checklist containing questions and a Java code file.
Based on the contents of the Java file, you must answer all the questions. The answers to the questions can be in any format, but must be short (1-2 sentences).

Code:
```java
{code}
```

Checklist:
* What security vulnerabilities is this code susceptible to?
* Are authorization and authentication handled in the right way?
* Is (user) input validated, sanitized, and escaped to prevent cross-site scripting or SQL injection?
* Is sensitive data like user data, or credit card information securely handled and stored?
* Does this code NOT reveal some secret information like keys, passwords, or usernames?
* Is data retrieved from external APIs or libraries checked accordingly?
* Does error handling or logging NOT expose the system to vulnerabilities?
* Is the right encryption used?
* Is sensitive data encrypted in storage and in transit?
* Would having access to the codebase affect the security of the application (does code contain hard-coded secrets)?

Based on the answers given, you must provide a final verdict (one line for every potential discovered weakness). The final verdict must be in the format:
 vulnerability: <YES or NO> | vulnerability type: <CWE_ID> | <short one sentence explanation>
If no vulnerabilities are present, respond with: "Not vulnerable"
