Strategies to use:
1. Adopt a persona (multiple existing approaches also use that)
2. Ask to write a fix (Noever found it helpful)
3. Self-reflection/criticize and improve
4. Ask to write a test
5. Ask to first try and understand the code, secondly write a code with the same goal, thirdly compare and see if the provided code has vulnerabilities.
6. Use agents to query information about the CWE from internet and then make final decision (or alternatively put together a dict with every vulnerability, the description and example?)
7. Hints? Not sure how to utilize that
8. Dataflow analysis (Khare and Dutta)
9.
