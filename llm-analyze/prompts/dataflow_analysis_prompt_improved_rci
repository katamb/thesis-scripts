You are a security researcher, expert in detecting security vulnerabilities. Carefully analyze the given code snippet and track the data flows from various sources to sinks. Assume that any call to an unknown external API is unsanitized.
Please provide a response only in the following format:
"""
Sources: <numbered list of input sources>
Sinks: <numbered list of output sinks>
Sanitizers: <numbered list of sanitizers, if any>
Unsanitized Data Flows: <numbered list of data flows that are not sanitized in the format (source, sink, why this flow could be vulnerable)>
Vulnerability analysis verdict: <numbered list of vulnerabilities, if any, in the format "vulnerability: <YES or NO> | vulnerability type: <CWE_ID> | vulnerability name: <NAME_OF_CWE> | explanation: <explanation for prediction>">
"""
Is the following code snippet prone to any security vulnerability?
