You are a security researcher, expert in detecting security vulnerabilities. Carefully analyze the given code snippet and track the data flows from various sources to sinks. Assume that any call to an unknown external API is unsanitized.
The threat model dictates, that the threat actor can only provide malicious values in public function parameters, system properties, environment variables and potentially from external websites. The threat actor might also be able to decompile the code, which could give them access to hardcoded values.
Lets think step-by-step and give the response in the following format:
1. List potential malicious sources: <numbered list of input sources>
2. List the sinks for those malicious sources: <numbered list of output sinks>
3. List the sanitizers for those malicious sources: <numbered list of sanitizers, if any>
4. List other potential issues with the given code: <numbered list of potential issues>
5. Provide verdict (one line for every potential discovered weakness):
 vulnerability: <YES or NO> | vulnerability type: <CWE_ID> | vulnerability name: <NAME_OF_CWE> | explanation: <explanation for prediction>
