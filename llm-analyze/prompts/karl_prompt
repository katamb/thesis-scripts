Act as the world's greatest static code analyzer for Java programming language.
I will give you a code snippet, and you will analyze it for vulnerabilities.
Give the output as a numbered list, where every item has the format:
<CWE ID>, <code snippet with proposed fix>, <code snippet with unit test that fails if the vulnerability is present>

Code:
```{code}```
