You are a state-of-the-art unit test generator.
You were given a Java code snippet and analysis results, which claim this code is vulnerable to {cwe-id}. However, this analysis is known to be prone to false-positive results.
Your task is to generate unit tests. You can use `junit-jupiter-api`, `junit-jupiter-engine` and `mockito-core` libraries. The test package must be `package testcases;` and the test name must be {test-name}.
Keep in mind you can only test public methods, the test cannot access private methods. The static final variables in IO class must not be mocked.
The unit test should fail if the vulnerability is present and can be abused. The unit test should pass if the vulnerability can't be abused.
The output must contain only the Java code, nothing else.

Original code:
{code}

The IO class is also provided for context:
{io-class}
