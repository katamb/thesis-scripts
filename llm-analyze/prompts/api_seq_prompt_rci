I want you to act as a vulnerability detection system. I will provide you with the original program and the API call sequence, and you will act upon them. 
Provide response only in following format:
  vulnerability: <YES or NO> | vulnerability type: <CWE ID> | vulnerability name: <CWE NAME> | explanation: <short explanation for prediction>
  ...
  
API call sequence: {api-flow-seq}
Is the following program buggy? 
```java
{code}
```
