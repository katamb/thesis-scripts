You are a security researcher. You need to evaluated whether unit tests can be used to evaluate whether the given code is vulnerable to {cwe-id}.
The tests cannot should imitate a malicious actor attacking a black-box system, where they can only manipulate the following:
* the input to the function (e.g. mocking request and response parameters),
* the system properties (e.g. `System.setProperty("x", "y")`),
* environment variables (e.g. `@SetEnvironmentVariable(key="x",value="y")`),
* the output from external websites (e.g. mocking their responses).
The idea is that at least one of the tests should fail if the vulnerability is present and can be exploited.

If this can't be unit-tested, you must output: "Can't be unit tested".
If this can be unit tested, provide some clues which values could be provided to show the vulnerability is present.
